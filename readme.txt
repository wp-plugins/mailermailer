Add your MailerMailer signup form to your WordPress site. Allow site visitors to easily subscribe to your email list.

== Description ==

The MailerMailer plugin allows you to easily add your signup form to your WordPress 3.5 or higher site through a widget or shortcode.

In order to use this plugin you must have an API key provided by MailerMailer. If you don't have a [MailerMailer](http://www.mailermailer.com/index.rwp) account, you're welcome to signup for a [free trial](https://www.mailermailer.com/signup.rwp) today.

After plugin installation, you'll be asked to enter your API key so that we can retrieve your form. You'll then be able to customize the form appearance before you add it to your site. 

You'll be able to adjust the following form settings:
* Title
* Text color
* Border color
* Border width
* Background color

Should you modify your signup form on MailerMailer, you'll be able to easily update it through the plugin.
